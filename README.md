# LeetCode
💻 Daily LeetCode grind by LiquidMaltose – solving problems, writing elegant code, and occasionally sprinkling in some chaos. 🍬 Just like maltose: yk sweet, sticky, and unshakably persistent.

# 💥 LiquidMaltose's LeetCode Lock-In

> "Ain’t no way I’m failing this for-loop IRL" – me, whispering to VSCode at 3AM

Welcome to the **perma-lock**, where I grind LeetCode problems like they owe me XP.  
I'm **LiquidMaltose** – part-time redstone engineer, full-time code gremlin – and this is where I brainrot through algorithms one problem at a time until I see Dijkstra’s ghost in my dreams.

## ⚙️ What This Is

This repo is:
- A collection of 1000+ hours of **mental scrimmage**
- The digital version of a **ranked solo queue** but for data structures
- My safe space to **mald**, **lock-in** and **full-commit** to cooking something in JS or Python

It's not just code, it’s a **mental warzone** and I'm dropping hot every day, finna XP farm.
